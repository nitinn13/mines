# ðŸ’£ Encrypted Mines â€” Built for the Arcium Hackathon

**Encrypted Mines** is a privacy-preserving twist on the classic *Mines* game, built using **Arciumâ€™s Confidential Compute Layer**.  
Every move, mine placement, and outcome is securely computed on **Arcium MXE (Multiparty Execution)** â€” ensuring that sensitive game logic never leaves the encrypted runtime.

## ðŸš€ Overview

This project was built as part of the **Arcium Hackathon**, showcasing how **on-chain games** can maintain *complete fairness and privacy* using encrypted computation.  

Instead of running the game logic on a public backend or frontend, we leverage **Arciumâ€™s MXE** to handle:
- Secure random mine placement  
- Encrypted win/loss determination  
- Game state verification without revealing internal values  

This demonstrates a practical use case for **confidential compute in Web3 gaming**.

## ðŸ”’ How Arcium Fits In

Traditional blockchain games expose logic and randomness publicly, making them vulnerable to exploitation.  
With **Arcium**, we can:
- Run game logic inside **encrypted multiparty enclaves**
- Use **secure randomness** for fair mine generation
- Keep all internal data â€” mine positions, outcomes â€” confidential from both players and hosts

> ðŸ§© The MXE acts as a decentralized, encrypted backend for the game, returning only verified results.

## ðŸŽ® Gameplay

1. Click **Start Game** to initialize a new encrypted session.  
2. Once the grid appears, select any cell.  
   - If you hit a **mine**, the MXE computes a *loss* state.  
   - Otherwise, the MXE verifies a *win* state.  
3. The frontend updates the result instantly based on the secure response.

The UI dynamically expands once the game begins and displays a clear status message below the grid.
